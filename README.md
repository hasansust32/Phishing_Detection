# Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project on **Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning**, implemented in Python with the help of Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately identifies phishing websites based on specific features and patterns.

## About the Project

Phishing is a malicious attempt to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details by impersonating trustworthy entities. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect phishing websites and protect users from potential scams.

### Key Features:
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from website URLs and metadata.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various machine learning algorithms to classify websites as phishing or legitimate.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess model performance.

## File Structure
- **`Phishing_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository (you are reading this file).
